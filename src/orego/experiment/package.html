<p>Classes for running and analyzing experiments.</p>

<p>To run an experiment:</p>

<ol>
<li> Edit (and recompile) ExperimentConfiguration.java. Here you can set the path to GNU Go
(or whatever standard opponent you're using), the command-line options to Orego for each
  condition, and other options. </li>

<li> Make and clear the results directory specified in ExperimentConfiguration.java. </li>

<li> If you are running on a cluster, run Broadcast using the command

        <pre><code>nohup java -cp /path/to/Orego/binaries/ orego.experiment.Broadcast &amp;</code></pre>

    If you are only running on a single machine, instead run GameBatch with the command
   
        <pre><code>nohup java -cp /path/to/Orego/binaries/ orego.experiment.GameBatch &lt;HOST> &amp;</pre></code>
   		
    where <code>&lt;HOST></code> is one of the hosts listed in orego.experiment.ExperimentConfiguration (note that if you are running an experiment locally, the host will probably have the form <em>hostname</em>.localhost, with <em>hostname</em> being the name of your computer. </li>

<li> Periodically run Collate to display the results. </li>
</ol>

<p>If you want to kill an ongoing experiment, run KillExperiment. Note that this is running
<code>kill -9 -1</code> on all of the machines listed in ExperimentConfiguration.java, so it
will kill all of your processes and log you out.</p>

<p>To check for statistical significance (whether one condition is better than another), run Significance.</p>
