Classes for running and analyzing experiments.
<p>
To run an experiment:
<ol>
<li>Clear out the results directory. If doing this from the command line makes you nervous
(it should!), use a script like this:
<p>
<code>
#!/bin/bash<br>
rm -f results/*
</code>
<p>
<li>Edit (and recompile) ExperimentConfiguration.java. Here you can set the path to GNU Go
(or whatever standard opponent you're using), the command-line options to Orego for each
condition, and other options.
<p>
<li>If you are running on a cluster, run Broadcast. You may find it useful to put this in a script:
<p>
<code>
#!/bin/bash<br>
nohup java -cp <i>/path/to/Orego/binaries/</i> orego.experiment.Broadcast &
</code>
<p>
If you are only running on a single machine, instead run GameBatch.
<li>Periodically run Collate to display the results.
</ol>
If you want to kill an ongoing experiment, run KillExperiment. Note that this is running
<code>kill -9 -1</code> on all of the machines listed in ExperimentConfiguration.java, so it
will kill all of your processes and log you out.
<p>
To check for statistical significance (whether one condition is better than another), run Significance.
